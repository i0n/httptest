httptest is a simple http client for performing integration tests on http endpoints.

It accepts a json or yaml manifest which defines your expectations for the service you would like to test.
If everything goes well the process will exit with code 0. It will exit with code 1 on any failure.
Have a look at test/fixtures/fixtures.json or test/fixtures/fixtures.yml for example manifests.
